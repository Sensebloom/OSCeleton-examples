OSCeleton-examples
=========

What is this?
-------------

Just a few simple demos we created  to demonstrate how
to use [OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton).
We have 2 processing sketches and 1 animata skeleton animation.


How do I use it?
----------------

Go get [OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton), follow
the instructions there and run the OSCeleton executable.

For the processing examples you need to get and install the
[OscP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/).

For the stickmanetic processing sketch you additionally need to get
and install
[pbox2d](http://code.google.com/p/pbox2d/).

Run the skecthes ;)

We also have an animata demo. Run OSCeleton with the options you see
in the .bat file, open the animata animation and have fun!


OSC Message format
------------------

Check the README on
[OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton)
and check the following method on the processing sketches:
    void oscEvent(OscMessage msg)
